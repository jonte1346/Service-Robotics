## **Project Overview**

This project involved developing a search and rescue robot capable of finding and carrying an injured person out of a building. This scenario was simulated where a small-scale autonomous robot, with appropriate sensors, had to find three ‘people’ (represented by small wooden cylinders) in a maze, and then carry them out of the maze.

The robot was required to complete this task completely autonomously within a maximum total time of 6 minutes.

## **Hardware and Components**

As a starting point, each team was provided with:

* A 2-wheeled robot platform  
* A Microcontroller Unit (MCU)  
* A pair of DC-motors  
* A motor driver  
* Servo motors  
* Ultrasound distance modules  
* Line follower sensors  
* Common electronic components

The robot platform was designed to be easily expandable through laser-cut MDF accessories. A key aspect of the project was designing and building the system used for carrying the 'people' out of the building entirely from scratch.

## **The Maze Environment & Task**

The simulated maze featured:

* Corridors at least 300mm wide and 150mm high.  
* A black line running down the center of the corridors.  
* Two squares within the maze where the black line was intentionally absent.  
* Two "islands" (areas not traversable) within the maze.

Three injured 'people' (small wooden cylinders) were placed inside the maze. One position was predetermined, while the other two positions were randomized immediately before each group's demonstration. Each cylinder was placed on a black line in the center of a square.
